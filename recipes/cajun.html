        <p>
          Heat the olive oil in a large, shallow saucepan or deep frying pan
          over a medium heat, then add the chicken, season lightly and fry for
          6-8 mins, stirring occasionally until just golden all over â€“ no need
          to worry about it being cooked through at this stage.

          Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then scatter over the
          Cajun-style seasoning and stir so the chicken pieces are evenly
          coated. Tip in the tomatoes, a quarter of a can of water and the stock
          cube. Stir, then bring to a simmer and cook for 5 mins.

          Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the
          pasta for a minute less than pack instructions. Stir the cream into
          the chicken and continue to simmer gently. When the pasta is cooked,
          drain well and stir into chicken mixture. Finish cooking the pasta in
          the sauce over a low heat for 2 mins, then stir in the parmesan and
          lemon juice, and cook for 1 min more. Serve the pasta straight from
          the pan, or tip into a large serving bowl. Scatter with parsley, if
          you like, and extra parmesan.
